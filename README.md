# AI Resume Advisor using Large Language Models (LLMs)

This project is an AI-powered Resume Advisor that analyzes a candidate’s resume against a given Job Description using a Large Language Model (LLM). The system provides structured, human-like feedback to help candidates understand their strengths, skill gaps, and areas for improvement.

The AI Resume Advisor takes two text inputs:
- Resume text
- Job Description text

Using prompt engineering, the LLM is instructed to act as an AI Career Advisor and generate:
1. Overall resume–JD match assessment  
2. Key strengths of the candidate  
3. Missing skills or gaps  
4. Suggestions to improve the resume  

This project demonstrates practical usage of Generative AI and prompt engineering in a real-world career guidance application.
